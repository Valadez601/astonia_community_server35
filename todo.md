* Make it so Skellie 2 can be accessed at all times. Making a player wait up to potentially 70 minutes for a beginner quest with no good alternatives is oof. All servers have essentially changed this.
* Add /killbless & /killpotion commands as part of the default server commands.
* Add mithril armor/weapons to Egbert/Dolf - expecting new players to beat Cameron with iron/steel is rough. Remove heavier armor from Egbert - newbie trap.
