# Quests

## Jeepers Creepers (Aston, Kelly)

Targeted at level 15, but you might get it as early as lvl 12-13. Seems too hard at first. Rushing and war-crying kills you quickly. Sneaking and taking them one-by-one works fine. Stealth really shines here, even if unraised.

**1850 EXP, 12% of level 15.**

_Add hint about stealth to mission briefing?_

## Underground Park Shrines (Aston, Kelly)

Feels easier then Creepers at first. Larger groups with evasive mages can be challenging, though. Three shrines to find. That's one big park...

**4500 EXP, 25% of level 16.**

## Astronomer's Notes (Aston, Gerassimo)


**5000 EXP, 27% of level 16.**
