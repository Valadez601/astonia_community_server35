# Quests

## Jeepers Creepers (Aston, Kelly)

Targeted at level 15, but you might get it as early as lvl 12-13. Seems too hard at first. Rushing and war-crying kills you quickly. Sneaking and taking them one-by-one works fine. Stealth really shines here, even if unraised.

**1850 EXP, 12% of level 15.**

_Add hint about stealth to mission briefing?_

## Underground Park Shrines (Aston, Kelly)

Feels easier then Creepers at first. Larger groups with evasive mages can be challenging, though. Three shrines to find. That's one big park...

**4500 EXP, 25% of level 16.**

## Astronomer's Notes (Aston, Gerassimo)


**5000 EXP, 27% of level 16.**

## Smuggler Book (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

Went right past the book and cleared the section. Found the book on the way back.

** 1000 EXP, 6.7% of level 15.**

## Contraband (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

Quest items as random drops. Not sure if this is a good idea. I got all but one twice on a single run, so it might be fine.

**4x1000 EXP, 27% of level 15.**

## Smuggler Leader (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

Guild leader was a wimp, continuing the tradition.

_The kill does not count unless you received the quest already. Considering that many players will just clear the area right away this might need fixing.
